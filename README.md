# Wine-quality-ML-
Predicting Wine Quality using Wine Quality Dataset

It’s a well-established fact that age makes wine better – the older the wine, the better it will taste. However, age is not the only thing that determines a wine’s taste. Numerous factors determine the wine quality certification, including physicochemical tests such as alcohol quantity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, density, and pH level, to name a few. In this ML project, we developed an ML model that can explore a wine’s chemical properties to predict its quality. The wine quality dataset we have used for this project consists of approximately 4898 observations, including 11 independent variables and one dependent variable. Mentioning Machine Learning projects for the final year can helped resume look much more interesting than others.

The requirements for the project are
Explain feature engineering Trying cross validation and Hyperparameters tuning will be a plus. Try at least 2 models and prepare the report with the performance comparison and reasoning why one is better than another.

Our goals for this notebook:

<b>Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis </b>

Exploratory Data Analysis: understand the data by EDA and derive simple models with Pandas as baseline

<b>Part 2: Data wrangling and feature engineering</b>

Data wrangling: fill nan, convert categorical to numerical, create train and test data for ML algorithms

<b>Part 3: Trying cross validation and Hyperparameters</b>

<b>Part 4: Comparison of Model results use metrics like confusion_matrix, classification_report, accuracy_score and implement k fold cross validation for comparison of test score</b>
