    <h3>Predicting Wine Quality using Wine Quality Dataset</h3>
     <p> </br></br>
    In this ML project, we developed an ML model that can explore a wineâ€™s
    chemical properties to predict its quality. </br> The wine quality dataset we have used for this project
    consists of approximately 4898 observations, including 11 independent variables and one dependent variable.
    </br>
    Mentioning Machine Learning projects for the final year can helps resume look much more interesting than others.
    </br></br>
       <b>The requirements</b> for the project are: </br>- Explain feature engineering Trying cross validation and Hyperparameters
    tuning will be a plus. </br>- Try at least 2 models and prepare the report with the performance comparison and reasoning
    why one is better than another.</br></br>
       This project was implemented by </br>
       - Levon Yeghiazaryan</br>
       - Lilit Simonyan</br>
       - Mary Aydinyan</br>
